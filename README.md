# CodeVerse

A comprehensive coding platform analytics dashboard that aggregates and visualizes your coding stats from multiple platforms.

## Quick Start
## CodeVerse — Project Overview

CodeVerse is a full-stack project that aggregates coding activity across multiple online judge and repository platforms and presents a consolidated analytics dashboard. This repository contains a Node.js + Express backend (with MongoDB) and a React + Vite frontend.

This README documents repository layout, how to run the project locally, and where to find the important pieces of the codebase.

---

## Repository layout

- `CODEVERSE-PROJECT/`
	- `backend/` — Node.js / Express server, Mongoose models, controllers, and platform integration services.
		- `src/controllers/` — API controllers (analytics, auth, platforms, leaderboard, rooms...)
		- `src/models/` — Mongoose models (`User`, `Room`, `DailyProgress`, etc.)
		- `src/services/` — platform scraping/aggregation services (GitHub, LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.)
		- `src/routes/` — Express route definitions
		- `package.json` — backend dependencies & scripts
	- `frontend/` — React + Vite application (TailwindCSS, lucide-react icons, recharts)
		- `src/pages/` — main page views (`Dashboard.jsx`, `SettingsPage.jsx`, `ComparisonPage.jsx`, etc.)
		- `src/layouts/` — shared layouts like `Sidebar.jsx`, `DashboardLayout.jsx`
		- `src/components/` — reusable UI components
		- `src/services/api.js` — API client used by the frontend
		- `package.json` — frontend dependencies & scripts
	- project docs and phase files (implementation notes, roadmap, guides)

Files generated by the build (frontend `dist/`) have been removed from the repo to keep it clean. Rebuild will recreate them locally.

## Quick start — Development

Prerequisites: Node.js (16+ recommended), npm or yarn, MongoDB (local or hosted).

1. Backend

```bash
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/backend
npm install
# dev: starts with auto-reload if nodemon is configured
npm run dev
# production:
npm start
```

Environment variables (create `.env` in `backend/`):

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
# Optional: any platform-specific tokens
```

2. Frontend

```bash
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

To produce a production build (creates `frontend/dist/`):

```bash
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend
npm run build
```

Note: `frontend/dist/` was intentionally removed from the repository (build artifacts). Re-run `npm run build` to recreate it.

---

## Important files and entry points

- Backend server: `CODEVERSE-PROJECT/backend/src/server.js` (or `app.js`/`index.js` depending on layout)
- Frontend entry: `CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend/src/main.jsx` → `App.jsx`
- Dashboard UI: `CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- Sidebar/navigation: `CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.jsx`
- API client: `CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend/src/services/api.js`

If you need to troubleshoot rank/leaderboard problems, check the backend leaderboard controller and its route: `backend/src/controllers/leaderboardController.js` and `backend/src/routes/`.

---

## Common tasks

- Install dependencies (backend + frontend)

```bash
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/backend && npm install
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend && npm install
```

- Run both services locally (from repo root using two terminals):

Terminal 1 (backend):

```bash
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/backend
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2 (frontend):

```bash
cd CODEVERSE-PROJECT/frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## Environment / Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: recommended (personal access token) for accurate GitHub contribution statistics. Without a token the app may only fetch limited data or rate-limit quickly.
- Database: `MONGODB_URI` must point to a working MongoDB instance.

Never commit `.env` files or tokens to the repository. Add any generated build folders (e.g., `dist/`) and local caches to `.gitignore` if needed.

---

## Removed / cleaned items

- Removed frontend `dist/` build artifacts to keep repository size small (you can regenerate with `npm run build`).
- No source application code was removed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the frontend shows a blank page after edits, run `npm run build` to check for syntax errors.
- If leaderboard rank API returns `500`, inspect backend logs and the controller at `backend/src/controllers/leaderboardController.js`. Typical issues: missing DB index, malformed aggregation, or missing data.

## Contribution & Notes

If you plan to contribute, please:

1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Run tests (if available) and verify linting.
3. Open a PR with a clear description of changes.
